### Description

`shinybreakpoint` is a Shiny module which one can add to the Shiny
application. Is an answer to the problem with setting (editor)
breakpoint in the modules stored in separate files - currently it is not
possible to do this in RStudio IDE. With `shinybreakpoint` breakpoint
can be set in the reactive context in any file making developing
modularized Shiny applications easier.

### Installation

You can install the development version of `shinybreakpoint` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gsmolinski/shinybreakpoint")
```

### Documentation

See the whole documentation in the
[Articles](https://gsmolinski.github.io/shinybreakpoint/articles/index.html)
section.
