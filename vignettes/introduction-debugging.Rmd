## I. The Code

### Overview

`shinybreakpoint` is designed to display in the Shiny app (i.e. when the app runs) parts of the source code used in the app and to allow to set breakpoint in *some* places of the displayed source code. Thus it should be clear from the beginning that this package has two-stage limitations:

-   breakpoint can't be set on the lines which are *not* displayed
-   breakpoint won't be set on *all* lines which are displayed

Setting breakpoint is a debugging technique - when the point (line of code) is reached, code execution is halted, debug mode is enabled and one can check the values of objects or perform any other operations in the temporary environment (i.e. all changes exist only in the debug mode). It is one of the method to find out why unexpected behavior occurred.

`shinybreakpoint` do not provide *new* technique for Shiny apps - it is already possible to set breakpoint using e.g. RStudio IDE, but the current solution has its own limitation. Breakpoint can't be set when the code is split into multiple files (which is often the case when app is built of modules). Although `shinybreakpoint` gives the solution for that, it makes it in the radical way - the code has to be split into (at least one), separated from `server` part, function.

### Usage

#### Setting breakpoint

We will start from the snippet - minimal skeleton needed to successfully run the Shiny app with the `shinybreakpoint` functionality:

    library(shiny)

    ui <- fluidPage(
      
    )

    appServer <- function(input, output, session) {
      # here will be the code which will be run in the
      # 'server', not in the 'server' itself
    }

    server <- function(input, output, session) {
      appServer(input, output, session)
      shinybreakpoint::shinybreakpointServer()
    }

    shinyApp(ui, server)

it is very similar to the regular Shiny snippet, however with the one significant difference - the server part is duplicated.

This duplication is necessary, because when the breakpoint is set using `shinybreakpoint`, the session is refreshed to enable changes in the code (these changes are the code added to the chosen line, i.a. `browser()`). Refreshment works only for objects nested in the functions which are then call in the `server` part. In other words, breakpoint won't work for objects used directly in the `server`, but these objects will be visible in the source code. As an example that works, we can consider the code below.

    library(shiny)
    library(magrittr)

    ui <- fluidPage(
      numericInput("num1", "Num", 1),
      numericInput("num2", "Num", 2),
      actionButton("go", "Go")
    )

    appServer <- function(input, output, session) {
      observe({
        input$num1
      })
      
      observe({
        input$num2
      }) %>% 
        bindEvent(input$go)
    }

    server <- function(input, output, session) {
      appServer(input, output, session)
      shinybreakpoint::shinybreakpointServer()
    }

    shinyApp(ui, server)

The key concept is that all code on which we possibly would like to set breakpoint is separated from the `server` (`shinybreakpoint::shinybreakpointServer()` does not necessary need to be use in the `server`, it could be used in the `appServer` as well). When the app is built of modules, this separation is achieved *by definition*, but when not, then `shinybreakpoint` needs this additional step.

To run the example above, one should save the file with the code, run the app and press `F1` (as this is key used by default, check out the other parameters by running `?shinybreakpoint::shinybreakpointServer` in the console) - the modal dialog will pop up. In our example there are two numeric inputs and one button in the `UI` as well as two `observe`s (one is *eager* - will run immediately and one will run only after the button is pushed) in the `server`. `observe`s will be visible in the modal dialog and breakpoint can be set on two lines:

-   `input$num1` and
-   `input$num2`

other possibilities won't work. Generally we can say that breakpoint won't be set on the *edges* of the visible code blocks.

Immediately after the breakpoint is set (i.e. when the `Activate` button in the modal dialog is pushed), session is refreshed. That means that if the breakpoint in our example was set on the `input$num1` line, debug mode will open up immediately, but if it was set on the `input$num2`, then `Go` button needs to be pushed. That fact strictly depends on the reactive programming - debug mode opens up when the code block (where breakpoint is set) starts and the chosen line is achieved.

Before we move into debug mode, something more has to be said about *visible code blocks*. `shinybreakpoint` tries to find and display only objects which belong to *reactive context* (`observe`s, `reactive`s and `render*`s), however it is not guaranteed that *all* of these objects will be find and that *only* these objects will be find. If so, one should remember that `shinybreakpoint` was designed to work with objects which belong to reactive context and thus it can lead to errors if using on other objects.

#### Debug mode

As already said, debug mode is an (temporary) environment when is possible to run arbitrary code and thus is very helpful to check if e.g. variables have the expected values. Although this vignette is not about debugging (many helpful documents are possible to find easy), some things in the context of the `shinybreakpoint` package should be highlighted.

Setting breakpoint is nothing more than inserting `browser()` in some place of code, but `shinybreakpoint` inserts more than this. All of the added code (in total four lines of code) is harmless, but will be visible in the debug mode. It can be run (if one would like to step down line-by-line) or ignore.

Breakpoint is constructed to be a one-time breakpoint, which means that after pressing `c` or `f` in the debug mode, Shiny app won't have active breakpoint anymore (to set it again, modal dialog delivered by `shinybreakpoint` must be use again). There is, however, case when it could look like the breakpoint persist - during the debug mode, the app still runs and the objects in `UI` can be use. If we take as an example our example above we could notice the following behavior: set the breakpoint on `input$num1` line, activate it and during the debug mode, change the `input$num1` in the app - then when we press `c` in the debug mode (to continue execution of code to the end of block and then exit), we will notice that we end up in the debug mode again, but now with the different value of `input$num1`. If we decide to change again `input$num1` in the app, this situation will repeat, but if not, the debug mode will close successfully after pressing `c`.

And the last thing - if something is displayed on the screen in the app, it can be impossible to see its value just be typing the variable name in the debug mode, and it can be necessary to use `sink()` before (in the debug mode). In our example that would be the case if we would have `renderPrint` where we would like to display `input$num1`.
